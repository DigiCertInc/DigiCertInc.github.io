        <p>VoIP or voice over IP (Internet protocol) is a transmission mode designed for use in voice and multimedia communications. As IP (Internet protocol)-based networks like the Internet seem to be most successful communications infrastructure, the traditional telephone network is currently being replaced VoIP. Nowadays, its clear improvements and advantages over the old systems make it a popular substitute, with a number of advantages. Among them:</p>  <p>The low cost of VoIP as compared to a traditional telephone network. There are any number of services available free of cost (like Skype) that allow you to communicate over distances long or short, PC-to-PC and free of cost.</p>  <p>VoIP is portable. Portability and mobility is another advantage of VoIP over traditional telephone; you only need an Internet connection for communication.</p>  <p>VoIP service includes a number of different advanced features not normally available with traditional telephone service, including call forwarding, conference call, caller ID, virtual numbers and more.</p>  <p>The advantages are many but this is not our main topic of discussion. (Likewise, there are a number of disadvantages, too: VoIP services depend on Internet connection speed; voice quality depends on the performance of your computer, and so forth). So what is our point in discussing this? What we examine here will be the security aspect of VoIP. In this article, we will review:</p>  <p>An overview of VoIP </p>  <p>What is Asterisk? (and what are the functionalities) </p>  <p>What is Trixbox? </p>  <p>VoIP hacking (Penetration testing on an asterisk based network)</p>  <p>With so many aforementioned advantages, VoIP is gaining popularity among both organizations and private users alike. But what about the security issues? As should be entirely predictable, any new technology immediately presents opportunities for those seeking to cause mischief. This is confirmed by reports I’m sure you’ve heard about: not just the phone hacking scandal in Britain, but the hacking in which thieves easily steal confidential information from a victim because their network was not secure.</p>  <p>If you are a pen tester or ethical hacker, then you have an idea about the importance of penetration testing in VoIP, because most of the important communications going on today occur on VoIP and securing confidential information is therefore critical. We will do some practical penetration testing on a VoIP-based network, but first of all I will show you how to build it.</p>  <p>Asterisk is an open-source software that can turn your computer into a communications server. There’s an asterisk software for PBX (private branch exchange) that allows you to make calls and transfer your data.</p>  <p>Trixbox is a wonderful software (or PBX: private branch exchange), based on the asterisk project. It was formally known as but in October 2006 it was renamed Trixbox. The difference between trixbox with other PBX is that trixbox is based on IP (Internet protocol) and has been designed for small and medium sized businesses. There are mainly two version of trixbox available: one is Trixbox CE (a free and open source), while the other – called Trixbox Pro – is one that you will need to purchase.</p>  <p>Protocols &amp; Ports</p>  <p>You must have an idea about the protocols and their ports before attempting to launch actual penetration testing on a VoIP network.</p>  <p>SIP (or session initiation protocol) has been defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as the protocol for VoIP communication (in other words: a signaling protocol). SIP uses port 5060 and 5061 for both TCP and UDP.</p>  <p>SDP or session description protocol is for multimedia communications, while MGCP (media gateway control protocol) uses port number 2427 and 2727 for UDP.</p>  <p>RTP (real-time transfer protocol) defines the packets to deliver videos and audios on IP based network like VoIP. RTCP (RTP control protocol) is just like RTP, and it is used to structure the packets that are defined by RTP.</p>  <p>IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) is an important protocol used in the asterisk system and is supported by a different soft-phone and PBX. IAX2 is the second version of IAX and works on the UDP port number 4569.</p>  <p>VoIP Penetration Testing</p>  <p>The process of penetration testing on a VoIP network is generally the same as the penetration testing on any other network. All we need to do is to follow the general guidelines, starting with information gathering, as we would with any form of penetration testing. We will do the same on VoIP network.</p>

        今天我们来看看溢出一台有漏洞的主机对于新手来说最基础也是最简单的一种方法，需要的工具有：     nmap    Nessus    Metasploit   当然你也可以用直接Backtrack 5的系统，因为以上工具都已集成在此系统中了。  首先Nmap的作用就是扫描目标主机开放的端口和服务，于是db_autopwn命令就针对开放的端口和开启的服务尝试运行溢出代码。而且它的扫描和溢出结果可以导入到更为细腻的审计工具Nessus中。
